# BanishCards Mod for Rogue Tower

BanishCards its a mod that lets you banish unwanted upgrade cards during your Rogue Tower runs, helping you execute clean, focused strategies while reducing RNG frustration.

Remove cards that clutter your upgrade pool, avoid prerequisites you don't need, and keep your build aligned with your run goals.

## Installation

    Download the mod.

    Drag and drop the .dll file into your BepInEx/plugins folder.

    Run the game.

## Configuration

    On first launch, the mod will automatically generate a configuration file in the BepInEx/config folder.

    Here, you can modify the maximum number of banishes per run (MaxBanishes) to your preferred limit.

    You can also customize the banish button color.

## Features

    Banish Upgrades:
    Select and banish upgrade cards during a run instead of accepting them.

    Strategic Pruning:
    Banishing a card:

        Permanently removes it from your upgrade pool for the current run.

        Prevents prerequisites tied to that card from appearing.

        Does not provide the card’s benefits; it is simply removed.

    Balanced:
    A configurable banish limit (default: 3) keeps the feature strategic and non-abusive.

    Perfect for Challenge Runs:
    Useful for achievements like “Win One-Lane with only Ballistas,” letting you remove cards that would dilute your strategy.
