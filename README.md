# BanishCards Mod for Rogue Tower

## Take control of your upgrade pool.

### BanishCards allows you to remove up to 3 unwanted upgrade cards during a Rogue Tower run, reducing RNG frustration and letting you execute clean, focused strategies for challenge runs and personal builds.
Features

    Banish Upgrades:
    Select and banish up to 3 upgrade cards per run instead of accepting them.

    Strategic Pruning:
    Banishing a card will:

        Permanently remove it from your upgrade pool for the current run.

        Prevent any upgrades that require it as a prerequisite from appearing later.

        Not provide any benefits—the card is simply removed.

    Keep Your Build Clean:
    Perfect for achievement runs like “Win One-Lane using only Ballistas,” enabling you to remove upgrades that would otherwise dilute your intended strategy.

    Balanced:
    A strict 3-card banish limit per run keeps the feature strategic rather than exploitable.

## Why?

### Rogue Tower’s upgrades are essential for scaling difficulty, but they can lead to RNG-heavy runs when pursuing challenge achievements or specialized builds. By enabling selective removal, BanishCards adds meaningful choices without disrupting the game’s balance.
